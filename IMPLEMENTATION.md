# Product Pages Fetcher - Implementation Summary

This document verifies that all requirements from the problem statement have been implemented.

## Requirements Checklist

### Config File
- ✅ **Location**: `data/[projectname]/config.json`
- ✅ **Contains**:
  - One or more category list page URLs
  - Count/quota (number of products to fetch)
  - List of specific required product URLs
  - Sample config file provided

### Rosetta File
- ✅ **Location**: `Products tools/rosetta.json`
- ✅ **Contains**:
  - Known selectors for product items and links
  - Site-specific selector configurations
  - Default fallback selectors

### Workflow Implementation

#### 1. Parse Config File
- ✅ Implemented in `parseConfig()` method
- ✅ Validates required fields
- ✅ Loads project configuration

#### 2. Identify Required Product URLs
- ✅ Required products are stored in config
- ✅ Guaranteed to be fetched (handled in `selectProductsToFetch()`)

#### 3. Assemble Complete List of Product URLs
- ✅ Read category list page URLs from config
- ✅ Add all required product URLs first
- ✅ Discover product URLs from category pages using rosetta selectors
- ✅ Randomly select products distributed across category pages
- ✅ Exclude required products from random selection
- ✅ Deduplication by URL (using Map data structure)
- ✅ Additional deduplication by SKU when available

#### 4. Save Category List Pages
- ✅ Implemented in `downloadCategoryPages()` method
- ✅ Downloads HTML to `data/[projectname]/category-N.html`
- ✅ Used for product URL discovery

#### 5. Download Product Pages
- ✅ Implemented in `downloadProductPages()` method
- ✅ Downloads product page HTML for each selected product
- ✅ Saves to `data/[projectname]/[product-name].html`
- ✅ Only downloads HTML (no images, CSS, JS)

### Additional Features

#### Filename Sanitization
- ✅ Implemented in `sanitizeFilename()` method
- ✅ Removes invalid characters
- ✅ Replaces spaces with hyphens
- ✅ Handles duplicate filenames

#### Rosetta File Usage
- ✅ Looks up selectors by domain
- ✅ Falls back to default selectors
- ✅ Supports both site-specific and generic configurations

#### Deduplication
- ✅ Uses Map to track discovered products by URL
- ✅ Uses Set to track fetched URLs
- ✅ Extracts SKU when available for additional deduplication

#### Parser Prompt
- ✅ Implemented in `promptForParser()` method
- ✅ Asks user after successful fetch
- ✅ Gracefully handles yes/no response

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Config parsing validation
- ✅ Rosetta file loading
- ✅ Filename sanitization
- ✅ Product selection logic

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Full workflow with mock HTML
- ✅ Product discovery from category pages
- ✅ Selector matching verification
- ✅ Deduplication testing

## Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: Each step of the workflow is a separate method
2. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for network errors and parsing failures
3. **Progress Reporting**: Console output at each workflow step
4. **Respectful Scraping**: 500ms delay between product downloads
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Supports multiple sites and selectors
6. **Robust URL Handling**: Normalizes relative and absolute URLs
7. **User-Agent Header**: Identifies as a browser
8. **Programmatic Usage**: Can be used as a module or CLI tool

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
node product-fetcher.js data/sample-project/config.json
```

### As Module
```javascript
const ProductFetcher = require('./product-fetcher');
const fetcher = new ProductFetcher('config.json');
fetcher.run();
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal Config
```json
{
  "projectName": "my-project",
  "categoryListPages": ["https://example.com/products"],
  "productQuota": 10,
  "requiredProductUrls": []
}
```

### Full Config
```json
{
  "projectName": "comprehensive-project",
  "categoryListPages": [
    "https://site1.com/category1",
    "https://site2.com/category2"
  ],
  "productQuota": 50,
  "requiredProductUrls": [
    "https://site1.com/product/must-have-1",
    "https://site1.com/product/must-have-2"
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- The script avoids duplicating data for required products
- Product names are sanitized when used as file/folder names
- Category list pages are used for product URL discovery
- Rosetta file provides known selectors for different sites
- All HTML files are saved locally for offline processing
- The script prompts to run the parser after completion (not yet implemented)

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement the Product Pages Parser script
2. Add support for pagination in category pages
3. Implement rate limiting per domain
4. Add proxy support for larger scraping operations
5. Implement retry logic for failed downloads
6. Add support for authentication/cookies
7. Generate summary reports with statistics
